AI Governance Guardrails for Healthcare Operations

Overview
This repository documents a practical, lightweight AI governance standard for healthcare operational workflows. It outlines acceptable AI use, minimum safeguards, and documentation practices designed to support efficiency while managing privacy, compliance, and operational risk.

Audience
Healthcare operations, revenue cycle, compliance, and administrative teams exploring AI-assisted workflows in regulated environments.

Intent
This is not a technical model governance framework. It focuses on day-to-day AI usage controls that support audit readiness, accountability, and human oversight.
How This Scales in an Organization
In a production environment, these guardrails would be enforced through policy, staff training, approved AI tool lists, and periodic review. Logging could be centralized, ownership assigned by role, and audits performed to validate adherence.
